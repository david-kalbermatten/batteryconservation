Batteryconservation is a small python script wich creates an appindicator which can be used to enable / disable battery conservation mode.
Its limited to stop charging at 60%, 80% or 90% and disabled (charging normally), but you can easially expand those functions if you wish to.
Please add the needed requirements.

Application was tested with a Lenovo Yoga 7 14ACN6.
